# Rowshan Moving Company – Google Reviews Live Integration

The code is prepared to load reviews automatically from the verified Rowshan Moving Company Google Business Profile. Until Google OAuth is authorized, `reviews.html` can safely display any approved reviews stored in Supabase without inventing ratings or review counts.

## Google requirements
1. Create/use a Google Cloud project for Rowshan Moving Company.
2. Request/enable Google Business Profile API access. If the Business Profile API quota is 0, submit Google's Basic API Access application.
3. Configure OAuth 2.0 with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage`.
4. The owner/manager of Rowshan Moving Company must authorize the application once. Never collect the owner's Google password.
5. Obtain the Business Profile account ID and verified location ID.

## Netlify environment variables
Add these to the `.` Netlify project. Keep secrets scoped to Functions and marked secret.

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` **secret**
- `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` **secret**
- `GOOGLE_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_BUSINESS_LOCATION_ID`
- `GOOGLE_REVIEWS_URL` (optional; public Google Reviews URL)

After adding/changing variables, redeploy the site. `/.netlify/functions/google-reviews` should then return `configured: true` plus `averageRating`, `totalReviewCount`, and reviews.

## Admin password recovery
The Administration login now has **Forgot / Set Password**. In Supabase Auth > URL Configuration, allow:

`https://rowshanglobal.com/modules/agenda/admin-reset.html`

The client enters the authorized admin email (for example the account already created for Rowshan Moving Company), receives the Supabase recovery email, and sets their own password. No password is stored in GitHub.
